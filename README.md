# First Website
This is my first time creating a professional website. This website is for a family-friend who works as a self-employed hairdresser and wanted a website to showcase her work.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Since this is my first website made, I completed it using mostly HTML and CSS, and added a bit of Javascript for mobile responsiveness. Everything was created by hand before I even learned about programming libraries - RIP me.
